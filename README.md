**Project Overview**
Blaze Engine is an engine designed to be as lightweight as possible with minimal overhead and the ability to run on older and weaker hardware. This is a passion project that is meant to help teach the developer (me) better code legibility, graphics api usage, and game engine architecture. Full transparency, this project is made by someone with no perfessional experience or education and should not be used as such. Feel free to contribute!

**Building the Engine**
Blaze Engine currently only supports windows (sorry linux and mac) and runs on MSVC for Visual Studio 2022, other versions of Visual Studio have not been tested

to build the engine:
- clone the source using:
  - `git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlazeTechDev/BlazeEngine.git`
- build the Visual Studio 2022 project by running the `generate_projects.bat` file
- open the Visual Studio solution and press f5
